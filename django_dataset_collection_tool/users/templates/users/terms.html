    <h2>Scope, Amendments</h2>
    <p>These terms of use govern the contractual relationship between LAION e.V., Herman-Lange-Weg 26, 21035 Hamburg (hereinafter referred to as "LAION") and users of the services on the website at https://dct.openempathic.ai/. They apply in their current version at the time of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
    <p>LAION reserves the right to change these terms of use at any time, including for existing users, especially in case of changes in the law, changes in the highest court rulings, and changes in LAION's offerings. When there are changes to the terms of use, existing users will be informed when accessing the website.</p>

    <h2>Subject Matter of the Contract, Conclusion of the Contract</h2>
    <p>LAION is committed to advancing self-learning algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence and making them available to the general public. One of LAION's goals is to develop language models that can be used as the basis for language-based dialogue systems equipped with empathy and emotional intelligence. LAION provides the user with a portal at https://dct.openempathic.ai/ through which the user can contribute to the development of the language model.</p>
    <p>The usage contract between LAION and the user is concluded by accessing the portal and accepting the present terms of use.</p>
    <p>The use of the portal is free of charge. There is no legal entitlement to use the portal on the part of the user. LAION is entitled, within the framework of contractual freedom, to exclude individual users from use without stating reasons, to restrict the offering, or to completely discontinue it.</p>
    

    <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
    <p>LAION's language model is still in development and may therefore have errors in function and content – it is a demo or test version. LAION does not provide any guarantee, especially for the accuracy, timeliness, and/or completeness of the content. The outputs of the language model or chatbot must not be used by the user as a basis for decisions. They do not constitute advice and are not intended for further use.</p>
    <p>LAION has taken comprehensive measures to prevent the machine learning model from generating unwanted content, such as discriminatory, glorifying violence, sexualizing, and infringing content. However, due to the extent of the training data, LAION cannot rule out the occasional generation of unwanted content by the language model. In addition, the portal also serves the purpose of minimizing unwanted content. LAION explicitly distances itself from the aforementioned content.</p>

    <h2>Portal Usage</h2>
    <p>The portal offers the user the opportunity to participate in the development of machine learning models and datasets by LAION. The user can annotate audio sequences through the portal. In this context, the user can correct transcriptions of audio sequences and create descriptions. In addition, the user can provide various details through the predefined attribute fields.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the user can also use the current version of the chatbot and engage in dialogues with the chatbot. The chatbot will not be available from the beginning but only when the language model has been sufficiently trained.</p>
    
    <h2>User Account</h2>
    <p>The user must create a user account to use the portal.</p>
    <p>By clicking the corresponding button on the portal's homepage, the user is taken to the login page. There, they can login via their email address.</p>
    <p>In the user area, the user can view their registered email address and statistics regarding portal usage.</p>

    <h2>User Obligations</h2>
    <p>In the context of evaluating and classifying, the user undertakes to evaluate and categorize audio sequences objectively and carefully. The user is prohibited from making false or misleading statements on the portal.</p>
    <p>The user undertakes not to misuse the portal. They undertake to refrain from all activities related to the portal that constitute a violation of applicable law, a violation of third-party rights, violations of youth protection principles, and violations of good morals.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the user undertakes not to enter or upload any content to the portal that contains personal data, contains or represents intellectual property or trade secrets of third parties, glorifies violence or calls for violence, is of a Nazi nature, calls for or glorifies child pornography, incites hatred or calls for hatred, discriminates against people based on their religion, sexuality, gender, political beliefs, worldview, or other reasons, can be interpreted as bullying, threats, or extortion, calls for harm to others or oneself, or calls for or approves of animal cruelty.</p>
    <p>LAION expressly reserves the right to report violations of these terms of use to the relevant authorities, especially law enforcement authorities, when aware of the use of the portal contrary to these terms of use.</p>
    <p>If a user notices obvious errors in the portal that are suitable for the abusive use of the portal or its contents, they are obliged to report the error to LAION immediately.</p>

    <h2>Term of Contract, Termination</h2>
    <p>The usage contract begins with the user's acceptance of these terms of use and is concluded for an indefinite period. It can be terminated at any time by both parties without observing a notice period.</p>
    <p>The user can terminate the usage contract by selecting the "Delete My Account" button in the user area, under the "Account" subsection. In all other cases, terminations must be in text form to be effective.</p>
    <p>The right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.</p>
    <p>The usage contract ends automatically if LAION discontinues the services on the portal.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The portal and its content regularly constitute protected intellectual property. In particular, all logos, layouts, graphics, texts, images, and videos are protected by copyright and trademark law.</p>
    <p>LAION grants the user a simple, non-transferable right to use the portal and its content. In terms of time, this right to use is limited to the duration of the usage contract. In terms of content, the right to use is limited to uses that are appropriate for the intended use of the portal.</p>
    <p>In particular, the user is prohibited from reproducing, modifying, decompiling, or making unauthorized parts of the portal available to third parties.</p>
    <p>The user grants LAION a simple, unrestricted, temporal, and spatial right to use the content uploaded by the user on the portal, especially texts. In terms of content, the right to use is limited to the operation of the portal and the (further) development of language models and training datasets. The right to use includes, in particular, the storage of the content and its reproduction, public accessibility, and sharing with third parties.</p>
    <p>The user warrants that the content uploaded by them on the portal is free of third-party rights, and they are authorized to grant rights to the content. If the operator is held liable by third parties due to the infringement of intellectual property rights, and such liability is based on the user's culpable actions, the user shall indemnify the operator from these claims and bear the costs of legal defense of the operator under the Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz (RVG) (German Lawyers' Fees Act).</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>Users are not allowed to enter personal data concerning themselves as part of using the services to improve the language model and use the chatbot.</p>
    <p>LAION processes the user's personal data in accordance with data protection regulations, especially the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Detailed information can be found in the privacy policy, available at: https://dct.openempathic.ai/.</p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>LAION is liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence. For simple negligence, LAION is only liable for damages arising from the violation of life, body, and health, the violation of a material contractual obligation (an obligation whose fulfillment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose observance the contractual partner regularly relies and can rely), violations of provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), violations of provisions of the Product Liability Act (ProdHaftG), and violations of other legal provisions, insofar as they do not allow for an exclusion or limitation of liability. </p>
    <p>In the case of simple negligent violation of material contractual obligations, the liability of LAION is limited in terms of amount to the foreseeable, typically occurring damage. Otherwise, liability of LAION is excluded.</p>
    <p>The above liability limitations also apply to the benefit of LAION's legal representatives and vicarious agents.</p>

    <h2>Final Provisions</h2>
    <p>The contractual relationship is exclusively governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).</p>
    <p>Should individual provisions of these terms of use, including this provision, be or become wholly or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected. In place of the invalid or missing provisions, the respective statutory provisions apply.</p>
    <p>If the customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from and in connection with contracts concluded with the inclusion of these terms of use is the registered office of LAION.</p>
    <p>These terms of use were originally written in the German language and subsequently translated into English. In case of discrepancies or doubts about the interpretation, the German original version always prevails.</p>

    <p>Date of the terms of use: October 2, 2023.</p>
