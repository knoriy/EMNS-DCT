                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                        <h5>Arousal:</h5> Arousal measures the level of intensity or activation of the speaker's 
                        emotions. It indicates how energetic, stimulated, or excited the speaker appears. 
                        Here are some guidelines to help you rate arousal (from 0 to 10):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Low Arousal:</strong> The speaker sounds calm, relaxed, or even bored.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium Arousal:</strong> The speaker appears moderately engaged, showing some level of interest or excitement.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Arousal:</strong> The speaker displays intense emotions, enthusiasm, or excitement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="lead mb-3">
                        <h5>Valence:</h5> Valence measures the speaker's emotional state. It indicates whether 
                        the speaker is experiencing positive or negative emotions. Here are some guidelines 
                        to help you rate valence (from -5 to +5):
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Negative Valence:</strong> The speaker displays sadness, anger, frustration, or other negative emotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neutral Valence:</strong> The speaker appears emotionally neutral or displays a lack of strong positive or negative emotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Positive Valence:</strong> The speaker expresses joy, happiness, satisfaction, or other positive emotions.</li>

                    <p>
                        <h5>Excellent:</h5> This label represents the highest level of quality. It indicates 
                        that the audio recording is clear, crisp, and free from any distortions, background 
                        noise, or technical issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Good:</h5> This label signifies a high-quality audio recording with minor imperfections 
                        that do not significantly affect the overall listening experience. There may be slight 
                        background noise or minor audio artifacts, but they are not distracting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Average:</h5> This label suggests a moderately satisfactory audio recording. It may have 
                        noticeable imperfections, such as intermittent background noise, occasional dropouts, or minor 
                        distortions. The recording is still intelligible, but there is room for improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Poor:</h5> This label indicates a low-quality audio recording that is marred by significant 
                        issues. It may have consistent background noise, noticeable distortions, frequent dropouts, or 
                        muffled sound. The recording may be difficult to understand or listen to without effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h5>Unusable:</h5> This label is reserved for audio recordings that are of such poor quality 
                        that they cannot be effectively used or understood. The recording may be heavily distorted, filled 
                        with excessive background noise, or plagued by continuous dropouts, making it impossible to extract 
                        meaningful information.

                    Choose words that accurately portray the speaker's emotional state within the given 
                    audio clip. Feel free to use multiple words if necessary to capture the complexity of 
                    emotions. Your annotations should reflect your honest interpretation of the speaker's 
                    emotions. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here â€“ we value your unique
